## 0.10.5 (2025-08-11)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9c28f3363c648e0fed88f5d63b2fac3aa4a545cf/> add parse_raw()
   When parsing arbitrary date inputs from the user with gix_date::parse(),
   the non-strict gix_date::parse_header() would accept a variety of inputs
   that do not match any of the known/accepted formats, but would
   nonetheless be accepted as being "close enough" to a raw date as found
   in git commit headers.
   
   The new parse_raw() function takes a stricter approach to parsing raw
   dates as found in commit headers, only accepting inputs that
   unambiguously match a valid raw date.
   
   The gix_date::parse() function is updated to use the new parse_raw()
   function instead of the less-strict parse_header(). This has the effect
   of making gix_date::parse() avoid mis-parsing various inputs that would
   otherwise have been accepted by gix_date::parse_header(). For example
   "28 Jan 2005".

## 0.10.0 (2025-04-25)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-37367d708e0aea72bf3cef00808ab0069be0a606/> Expose parsing for Time

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d559fa7d96a06372855fdef3c7ab3a7083ba7172/> remove `Time::sign` field as it's not needed anymore to round-trip.
   Round-tripping is now handled in the `gix-actor` crate using the `SignatureRef`
   type.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-57366d3ebd622af8927bb0e199ab8a3c0eafee99/> turn `SignatureRef::time` field into `&str`.
   We also add a `gix_date::Time::to_str()` method, along with related utilities,
   to be able to turn a parsed time back into a raw buffer conveniently.
   
   Further, remove `Time::to_bstring()` in favor of a `Display` implementation.

## 0.9.3 (2024-12-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-34d2fce57e2836f758387b6cb54ee1f11bebd473/> add support for 'any' unit, when parsing `<count> <unit> ago`.
   Similar to Git, any unit is allowed and will default to seconds, like `60 flurps ago`
   will mean a minute in the past.
 - <csr-id-c95135b0d0168393f4ccca9863ade7efac8b3379/> Parse relative months and years
   This extends `gix_date::parse::relative::span` to recognize times
   with "months" and "years", as in "3 months ago" and "2 years ago".
   Those units are supported by Git.
   
   The actual change here to the parsing code is very simple, because
   it is directly facilitated by #1474.
   
   The units "seconds", "minutes", "hours", "days", and "weeks"
   continue to be recognized (as before). Relative times like
   "1 year, 2 months ago" remain unrecognized.
   
   For background, see 43b6c06 (#498), c5c6bf6,
   https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/pull/1474#discussion_r1694769988,
   and
   https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/1696#issuecomment-2495526654.
   
   Note that this specific change does not itself fix issue #1696,
   which applies to the intepretation of "days" and "weeks", and now
   also applies in the same way to the interpretation of "months" and
   "years". (It continues not to apply to the interpretation of
   "seconds", "minutes", and "hours".)
   
   The tests are updated to cover "months" and "years", as well as to
   exercise a wider range of relative times, including showing which
   units (e.g. "days") are affected by #1696. A few sub-cases, of
   those adjusted or added here, test strings from a related test in
   Git, to allow comparison. But most are not related to cases there.
   
   As before, the tests pass on CI, or when the time zone is otherwise
   UTC, or with local time zones that never have DST adjustments.
   
   The sub-cases are reordered to be monotone increasing in the
   magnitude of the relative intervals tested (and thus monotone
   decreasing in the associated absolute timestamps), and the original
   input is kept zipped into the `actual` and `expected` arrays being
   compared. This way, if the assertion fails (such as due to #1696),
   it is clear and readable which sub-cases failed and exactly how, as
   well as what all the sub-cases are and what each sub-case tests.
   
   Reordering the sub-cases and preserving the inputs they parse in
   this way avoids the disadvantages of #1697 while keeping, and
   expanding on, its benefits.
   
   Failure, where it occurs, now looks like:
   
   --- STDERR:              gix-date::date time::parse::relative::various ---
   thread 'time::parse::relative::various' panicked at gix-date\tests\time\parse.rs:252:9:
   assertion failed: `(left == right)`: relative times differ

## 0.9.1 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4b20bd1a8da30eb2ed88adb390e5cf7994779556/> add `CustomFormat::new()` to allow construction.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-cdac4a9b04959b0fc71009b5c828cdcb10a38828/> remove workspace lints from Cargo manifests of fuzz-projects.
   They are not part of the parent workspace.

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

## 0.9.0 (2024-08-22)

<csr-id-28ac6572722f7ea31795dc0417521c70bcb6ec8f/>
<csr-id-1b9c30dfb43373a76f3b65ae90a74dc99a892821/>
<csr-id-5a88413a2d3acb5c4ba5e49e47a42f0182d9e9fb/>

This is a *breaking release* as the `time` is gone and it's API isn't available publicly anymore.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-a729c4b52242b9a8b02f3d0879bd481f23a3d719/> Don't panic on dates too far in the past when parsing them.

### Other

 - <csr-id-28ac6572722f7ea31795dc0417521c70bcb6ec8f/> switch from `time` to `jiff`
   This swaps out `time` for `jiff`. It doesn't completely remove `time`
   from the dependency tree. The last remaining use of `time` is in
   `prodash`, outside of the gitoxide project.
 - <csr-id-1b9c30dfb43373a76f3b65ae90a74dc99a892821/> bump MSRV to Rust 1.70
   The bump to Rust 1.70 (released over 1 year ago) is needed since that's
   Jiff current MSRV. This doesn't bump the MSRV of the broader gitoxide
   project, however, so this is probably wrong or incomplete.
 - <csr-id-5a88413a2d3acb5c4ba5e49e47a42f0182d9e9fb/> make `time` a private dependency of `gix-date`
   This should make the swap from `time` to `jiff` easier.
   
   This comment[1] indicates that it's okay for `time` to be a public
   dependency, but since this patch series is about swapping `time` for
   `jiff`, it seemed appropriate to take this step first. And in
   particular, it was *almost* already the case that `time` was a private
   dependency of `gix-date`. The only thing we really had to button up was
   the exposure of `time`'s custom formatting description language.
   
   Jiff doesn't support `time`'s custom formatting machinery and instead
   uses a strftime/strptime like API. We could expose that instead, but
   since nothing (other than a test) was actually utilizing `time`'s custom
   formatting machinery external to `gix-date`, I figured we might as well
   completely encapsulate it.

## 0.7.0 (2023-06-29)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-09fbfd2ac3100947c8ea96fdf6425032354aee1b/> support dates prior to the UNIX epoch.
   This means such dates can now be parsed and represented.
   We do this by switching the time representation from `u64` which
   is used in `git` to `i64` which is used in `libgit2`.

- <csr-id-bcad5c22049d56a25ef69d6c7a3344e78f9a1d4d/> Add `clippy::redundant-closure-for-method-calls` lint

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4bc0ae1eb313ad83c793f397af9ca791b9b171e5/> Represent time as 64 bit integer.
   That way, dates beyond 2038 are supported.
   
   Further, we rename `Time::seconds_since_unix_epoch` to `seconds`, and remove `seconds()`
   as there now is a new type, `SecondsSinceUnixEpoch`. In the same vein, we rename
   `Time::offset_in_seconds` to `offset` as it now has at type `OffsetInSeconds`.

## 0.5.0 (2023-04-19)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.4.3 (2023-02-20)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.
 - <csr-id-135d317065aae87af302beb6c26bb6ca8e30b6aa/> compatibility with `bstr` v1.3, use `*.as_bytes()` instead of `.as_ref()`.
   `as_ref()` relies on a known target type which isn't always present. However, once
   there is only one implementation, that's no problem, but when that changes compilation
   fails due to ambiguity.

## 0.4.2 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-41fc2bb20e6a926ffc3638c0fac21d733fdc2e3c/>
<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Other (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-41fc2bb20e6a926ffc3638c0fac21d733fdc2e3c/> `time::format::GIT_DEFAULT` -> `*::DEFAULT` and `*::DEFAULT` -> `*::GITOXIDE`.
  That way we properly indicate what we are doing and don't try to somewhat
  sneakily suggest that the default for git dates is something else
  due to personal preference.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-c24ea67f84aa48953949682672114715bee67432/> parse now takes the current time `parse(…, Option<time>)` as parameter.

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fe04934d783e4c53a79fae2e0d3b0c5802ea1809/> Adds fuzzer for date parser
 - <csr-id-f5c9aa827e3b9ffb82a52ad7f840c58aa0d654ed/> return the time that failed to parse in the error
 - <csr-id-4066ac7367d8e870522746429513fb7a357a2cc6/> Support git default date format
   This is the format output by default by `git log` or when using
   `--pretty=%ad`.
   
   The new git_date::time::format::GIT_DEFAULT format description may be used
   to output date strings in this format. It is also now used by
   git_date::parse() to accept date strings that may be in this format.
 - <csr-id-8094351fe547a0f6756b0ed29dc87a0e6b9ceec1/> Format git-style RFC 2822 date strings
   Git outputs the day-of-month field as a non-padded number whereas strict
   RFC 2822 date strings are supposed to use a zero-padded two-digit number.
   
   The new git_date::time::format::GIT_RFC2822 format description allows Time
   to be formatted in git's RFC 2822 style. (Whereas the existing RFC2822
   format description produces a strict RFC 2822 date string).
 - <csr-id-034c8dc4437c06dc8af702fbe9b86ec903c73a18/> bump version to 1.0 to prevent accidental inclusions downstream
   For some reason, cargo considers different patch releases breaking, so
   creating a new patch can break installation of gitoxide entirely.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs
 - <csr-id-8f7f9ce2b06ec884220b8cd5010b3df04b1ff0bc/> Raw and Unix formats.
 - <csr-id-4b0c2198f9d5b28584c717123c7cfb1b27724605/> Add ISO-strict format
 - <csr-id-c76fde7de278b49ded13b655d5345e4eb8c1b134/> initialize `Time` from `now_utc` and `now_local`
   Localtime support depends on some other factors now, but that
   will only get better over time.
   
   We might have to document `unsound_local_time` at some point.
 - <csr-id-aeda76ed500d2edba62747d667227f2664edd267/> `Time::is_set()` to see if the time is more than just the default.
 - <csr-id-cfb6a726ddb763f7c22688f8ef309e719c2dfce4/> Add `Time` type.
   It was originally from the `git-actor` crate.

   inputs that it should not have. Specifically, it would accept:
   
   - Any character for the timezone offset's sign

</details>

## 0.4.1 (2023-01-10)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.4.0 (2023-01-06)

<csr-id-41fc2bb20e6a926ffc3638c0fac21d733fdc2e3c/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4066ac7367d8e870522746429513fb7a357a2cc6/> Support git default date format
   This is the format output by default by `git log` or when using
   `--pretty=%ad`.
   
   The new gix_date::time::format::GIT_DEFAULT format description may be used
   to output date strings in this format. It is also now used by
   gix_date::parse() to accept date strings that may be in this format.
 - <csr-id-8094351fe547a0f6756b0ed29dc87a0e6b9ceec1/> Format git-style RFC 2822 date strings
   Git outputs the day-of-month field as a non-padded number whereas strict
   RFC 2822 date strings are supposed to use a zero-padded two-digit number.
   
   The new gix_date::time::format::GIT_RFC2822 format description allows Time
   to be formatted in git's RFC 2822 style. (Whereas the existing RFC2822
   format description produces a strict RFC 2822 date string).

### Bug Fixes

<csr-id-dff0aa0be600b9cd9518184fefa9b3c8fdb510f2/>

 - <csr-id-046af94f005a6e095f0d3616c0b57ef1f556f734/> Stricter raw date parsing
   The raw date parser (gix_date::parse::function::parse_raw()) accepted some
   inputs that it should not have. Specifically, it would accept:
   
   - Any character for the timezone offset's sign

### Other (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-41fc2bb20e6a926ffc3638c0fac21d733fdc2e3c/> `time::format::GIT_DEFAULT` -> `*::DEFAULT` and `*::DEFAULT` -> `*::GITOXIDE`.
  That way we properly indicate what we are doing and don't try to somewhat
  sneakily suggest that the default for git dates is something else
  due to personal preference.

## 0.3.1 (2022-12-19)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-39655f5f6fa39a55c4420f672e866c483f9b85ed/> Negative system timezone offsets should be serialized as such
 - <csr-id-f4ea59db0a429801ab40b1294da4bffd9e0f80b3/> correctly parse raw dates with negative timezone offsets
 - <csr-id-be603f593055309b74685bc2aebb8e35e6de2d59/> always consider timestamps as UTC when loading from commits

## 0.3.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.2.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-99905bacace8aed42b16d43f0f04cae996cb971c/> upgrade `bstr` to `1.0.1`
 - <csr-id-c24ea67f84aa48953949682672114715bee67432/> parse now takes the current time `parse(…, Option<time>)` as parameter.

## 0.1.0 (2022-08-24)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-034c8dc4437c06dc8af702fbe9b86ec903c73a18/> bump version to 1.0 to prevent accidental inclusions downstream
   For some reason, cargo considers different patch releases breaking, so
   creating a new patch can break installation of gitoxide entirely.

## 0.0.5 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### New Features

 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs
 - <csr-id-517677147f1c17304c62cf97a1dd09f232ebf5db/> pass --cfg docsrs when compiling for https://docs.rs

## 0.0.4 (2022-08-19)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-8f7f9ce2b06ec884220b8cd5010b3df04b1ff0bc/> Raw and Unix formats.
 - <csr-id-4b0c2198f9d5b28584c717123c7cfb1b27724605/> Add ISO-strict format

## 0.0.3 (2022-08-17)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.0.2 (2022-07-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-c76fde7de278b49ded13b655d5345e4eb8c1b134/> initialize `Time` from `now_utc` and `now_local`
   Localtime support depends on some other factors now, but that
   will only get better over time.
   
   We might have to document `unsound_local_time` at some point.
 - <csr-id-aeda76ed500d2edba62747d667227f2664edd267/> `Time::is_set()` to see if the time is more than just the default.

## 0.0.1 (2022-06-13)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-cfb6a726ddb763f7c22688f8ef309e719c2dfce4/> Add `Time` type.
   It was originally from the `gix-actor` crate.

## 0.0.0 (2022-04-14)

An empty crate without any content to reserve the name for the gitoxide project.
