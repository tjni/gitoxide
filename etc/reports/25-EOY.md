##### The year in numbers

And 365 days later as of 2025-12-31, we are counting **211,983 SLOC, up by 33,827**, which is 91% *of the year before* (➡*OTYB*) in **14845 commits up by 1,302** and 57%OTYB. There are **65 crates (clearly I miscounted last year)** and 2 binaries, with `ein` and `gix` as part of `gitoxide`. There are **186 unique authors (up by 35 and 76%OTYB)**. This means ~93 lines per day in ~3.5 commits each day. On GitHub there are **10695 stars (up by 1,416 which is 70%OTYB)** for ~3.9 stars per day.

The tool invocation `ein tool estimate-hours` now rates the project cost at **12284 hours (up by 1655 which is 87%OTYB) or ~1535 x 8-hour working days**, for an average working time of **4.20 hours in the past 365 days**.

My time-tracker reveals that I **spent 461h on open source work** (which is 52%OTYB) which is (still) dominated by `gitoxide` and which is supported [_via GitHub sponsors_](https://github.com/sponsors/Byron) at 287h (which is 46%OTYB). **2177h were for commercial work and consulting** (which is 213%OTYB). The **total of 2015 hours worked** boils down to **5.5 hours of work per day (38.75h per week)**, which is 105%OTYB.

My open-source work is still financially sustainable even without income through commercial work, which is something I am most grateful for.

Thus far, **I have spent the last 2084 days to getting `gitoxide` off the ground** (5.7y!), and it's still quite far from even reaching parity with `git2` despite making great strides. Even though feature-wise it's getting closer, it's still unclear how to get everything to stability while also making the API easy-to-use, yet powerful enough to squeeze out every last bit of performance.

### Plans and reality

For this year, there were no plans which definitely helps with not feeling unaccomplished. Looking back, I don't think I worked on any bigger feature, and it feels all like maintenance, improvements and of course, reviewing the various contributions which at least *felt* more numerous this year.
They must be the reason that the line count increase is *only* 91% of what it was last year - would it just have been me, I think it would have been 10%.

When looking back at the accomplishments of last year I am absolutely shocked that these are already one year old, many feel much more recent. Time flies.

Also, out of the back of my head, I don't recall any major contribution of mine. What's going on?

### Words of Gratitude

By now I am able to sustain myself and my family while following my calling, and for that I am incredibly grateful - I simply couldn't imagine a better use of my (life)time. Doing so would not be possible without the generosity of my sponsors and the trust of my clients: thank you, thank you *very much*!

Another big thanks goes to all the contributors which by now do most of the work, with special shout-outs to [Christoph Rüßler](https://github.com/cruessler) and [Eliah Kagan](https://github.com/EliahKagan).

#### Thanks, GitHub!

GitHub ran a security centric program that `gitoxide` could participate in, as represented by no other than [Eliah Kagan](https://github.com/EliahKagan) who couldn't be more suited for this task.

The opportunity came with a sponsorship and generous Azure credits. Now I hope to one day use them for something meaningful 😅.
GitHub also provides Copilot for free, which is incredibly useful to me, so special-thanks for that!

#### Thanks, Meta!

Meta sponsored `gitoxide` with 20.000USD in OpenCollective, and I am using it for paid maintenance now. This helps tremendously in putting more hours in maintenance, given that these can now compete with paid work.

Thank you 🙏!

#### Thank you, Josh!

[Josh Triplett](https://joshtriplett.org/), back in May 2021 became my first sponsor and *patron*, which did no less than change my life to be able to follow my calling. `gitoxide`, me and my family wouldn't be what they are today without him, and I am deeply grateful for that. Nothing ever has to change about this sentence.

As in 2025 I didn't manage to contribute all that much to [`buildit`](http://buildit.dev), and I don't know to what extent this can change next year.

Thanks for bearing with me!

#### Thank you, Cargo team, for bearing with me!

It's taking me years to finish the integration work and implement all features needed to fully replace `git2` in `cargo`, and yet the `cargo` team stays onboard with this work!

A bare-bones `reset` is definitely planned for 2026, and I will do my best to integrate it once it becomes available.

#### Thanks, GitButler!

Last but not least, let me thank GitButler and the wonderful people involved with it for bearing with me, particularly when I seem to be able to deliver any new feature in weeks 😅. But it's getting there, and early 2026 will be the year when the platform will stabilize, to be able to carry the future.

#### Thanks Everyone

It’s very likely that I failed to call *you* out for no other reason than swiss-cheese like memory, so let me thank you for the net-positive interactions we undoubtedly had.

Let’s do that again in 2026 :)!
