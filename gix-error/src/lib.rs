//! Common error types and utilities for error handling.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! * When there is **no callee error** to track, use *simple* `std::error::Error` implementations directly,
//!   e.g. `Result<_, Simple>`.
//! * When there **is callee error to track** *in a `gix-plumbing`*, use e.g. `Result<_, Exn<Simple>>`.
//!      - Remember that `Exn<T>` does not implement `std::error::Error` so it's not easy to use outside `gix-` crates.
//!      - Use the type-erased version in callbacks like [`Exn`] (without type arguments), i.e. `Result<T, Exn>`.
//! * When there **is callee error to track** *in the `gix` crate*, convert both `std::error::Error` and `Exn<E>` into [`Error`]
//!
//! # Standard Error Types
//!
//! These should always be used if they match the meaning of the error well enough instead of creating an own
//! [`Error`](std::error::Error)-implementing type, and used with `Result|Option::or_raise(<StandardErrorType>)`.
//!
//! All these types implement [`Error`](std::error::Error).
//!
//! ## [`Message`]
//!
//! The baseline that provides a formatted message.
//! Formatting can more easily be done with the [`message!`] macro as convenience, roughly equivalent to
//! `Message(format!("…"))` or `format!("…").into()`.
//!
//! ## Specialised types
//!
//! - [`ParseError`]
//!    - like [`Message`], but can optionally store the input that caused the failure.
//!
//! # [`Exn<ErrorType>`](Exn) and [`Exn`]
//!
//! The [`Exn`] type does not implement [`Error`](std::error::Error) itself, but is able to store causing errors
//! via [`ResultExt::or_raise()`] (and friends) as well as location information of the creation site.
//!
//! While plumbing functions that need to track causes should always return a distinct type like [`Exn<Message>`](Exn),
//! if that's not possible, use [`Exn::erased`] to let it return `Result<T, Exn>` instead, allowing any return type.
//!
//! A side effect of this is that any callee that causes errors needs to be annotated with
//! `.or_raise(|| message!("context information"))` or `.or_raise_erased(|| message!("context information"))`.
