/// Perform a merge between `our_tree` and `their_tree`, using `base_tree` as merge-base.
/// Note that `base_tree` can be an empty tree to indicate 'no common ancestor between the two sides'.
///
/// * `labels` are relevant for text-merges and will be shown in conflicts.
/// * `objects` provides access to trees when diffing them.
/// * `write_blob_to_odb(content) -> Result<ObjectId, E>` writes newly merged content into the odb to obtain an id
///    that will be used in merged trees.
/// * `diff_state` is state used for diffing trees.
/// * `diff_resource_cache` is used for similarity checks.
/// * `blob_merge` is a pre-configured platform to merge any content.
///     - Note that it shouldn't be allowed to read from the worktree, given that this is a tree-merge.
/// * `options` are used to affect how the merge is performed.
///
/// ### Unbiased (Ours x Theirs == Theirs x Ours)
///
/// The algorithm is implemented so that the result is the same no matter how the sides are ordered.
///
/// ### Differences to Merge-ORT
///
/// Merge-ORT (Git) defines the desired outcomes where are merely mimicked here. The algorithms are different, and it's
/// clear that Merge-ORT is significantly more elaborate and general.
///
/// It also writes out trees once it's done with them in a form of reduction process, here an editor is used
/// to keep only the changes, to be written by the caller who receives it as part of the result.
/// This may use more memory in the worst case scenario, but in average *shouldn't* perform much worse due to the
/// natural sparsity of the editor.
///
/// Our rename-tracking also produces copy information, but we discard it and simply treat it like an addition.
///
/// Finally, our algorithm will consider reasonable solutions to merge-conflicts as conflicts that are resolved, leaving
/// only content with conflict markers as unresolved ones.
///
/// ### Performance
///
/// Note that `objects` *should* have an object cache to greatly accelerate tree-retrieval.
