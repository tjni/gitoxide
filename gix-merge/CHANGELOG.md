## 0.2.0 (2024-12-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-da585db16bae9f44e6300f31b0f784c356d5bd3f/> don't incorrectly mark as auto-resolved conflict if there was none.
   Previously it was possible to mark perfectly working content merges as conflicting
   if we would choose 'our' or 'their' resolution.
 - <csr-id-a57192c0418aab2e3cd2ddb7b7a951cd3aaeb58f/> when binary merges are performed, adjust the returned resolution to indicate auto-resolution.
   Previously it wasn't possible to detect auto-resolution, even though it can be assumed if a
   resolution mode was provided.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1c3ba812bd3df5991a457b68a962aa1fd87fa915/> replace `tree::Options::allow_lossy_resolution` with `*::tree_conflicts`.
   That way it's possible to steer how to resolve tree-related conflicts while
   making it possible to detect that a conflict happened.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3e94b58f00334392da89fb2772034efe06d3a741/> assure that `tree::apply_index_entries()` cannot unknowingly leave unconflicted *and* conflicted entries.
   This is a massive footgun currently where incorrect usage is very likely while causing all kinds of mistakes.

## 0.1.0 (2024-11-24)

<csr-id-2fdbcfe17cdcc480e320582d7c6b48f8b615bf3b/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3ee8b62dd025d6fdb0d9929dec7a561fa576f545/> provide a way to record and apply index changes.
   These changes will then be applicable to an index that is created
   from the written tree editor.
 - <csr-id-09213bc1b2aa725af1571dff040415772e844c3a/> when blob-merging, clarify if something would have conflicted.
 - <csr-id-9e106c4ab7ceea091cd8baef99a480739bd53c9d/> add `Conflict::is_unresolved()` as utility to see if multiple of them are considered unresolved.
 - <csr-id-bd91d6ae97d1981a2366136040407590f64fdad4/> respect the `conflict-marker-size` attribute as well.
 - <csr-id-4b1764ca9148e08ae9f11bca68e0689b12bc8c80/> add `tree()` and `commit()` merge support, en par with `merge-ORT` as far as tests go.
   Note that this judgement of quality is based on a limited amount of partially complex
   test, but it's likely that in practice there will be deviations of sorts.
   
   Also, given the complexity of the implementation it is definitely under-tested,
   but with that it's mostly en par with Git, unfortunatly.
   
   On the bright side, some of the tests are very taxing and I'd hope this
   means something for real-world quality.
 - <csr-id-dd99991ec2bfb07ef571769abc32f1b35122d5ca/> add `blob::PlatformRef::id_by_pick()` to more efficiently pick merge results.
   This works by either selecting a possibly unchanged and not even loaded resource,
   instead of always loading it to provide a buffer, in case the user doesn't
   actually want a buffer.
   
   Note that this also alters `buffer_by_pick()` to enforce handling of the 'buffer-too-large'
   option.

### Other

 - <csr-id-2fdbcfe17cdcc480e320582d7c6b48f8b615bf3b/> Fix code fences in gix-merge `ConflictStyle` and `Driver`
   They are not Rust code (they are text with conflict markers and a
   shell command, respectively) and they are not intended as doctests,
   but the absence of anything on the opening line caused them to be
   taken as doctests, so `cargo test --workspace --doc` would fail
   with parsing errors.
   
   (Doctests for all crates have not always been run automatically on
   CI, so this was not caught when these documentation comments were
   introduced in #1585.)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-aff76f291a52fc6806944d72d249a8bd1b804c39/> Add more modes for checking for unresolved conflicts.
   They aim at making it possible to know if a conflict happened that was
   automatically resolved.
 - <csr-id-9d43b753a225482645b22e4151bf7dc192c8c082/> add `commit::virtual_merge_base()` to produce the single merge-base to use.
   This allows more flexibility in conjunction with tree-merging, as
   commits as input aren't required.
   
   This is breaking as it changes the return value of `commit()`.
 - <csr-id-1d2262f2ca416e3c22f9601e7eab11f3372b2128/> `Repository::merge_trees()` now has a fully-wrapped outcome.
   That way, more attached types are used for greater convenience.
 - <csr-id-c1cf08cc47f98abda017544b1791ab3b4463cc77/> Don't fail on big files during blob-merge, but turn them into binary merges.
   Binary merges are mere choices of which side to pick, which works well for big files
   as well. Git doesn't define this well during its own merges, so there is some room here.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-de1cfb6a9caf5ac086c6411824835c75e888e2d7/> Adjust blob-merge baseline to also test the reverse of each operation
   This also fixes an issue with blob merge computations.
   
   It's breaking because the marker-size was reduced to `u8`.
 - <csr-id-78a535572643a0657348aea3c2fed0123505f7fe/> prefer to receive borrowed `gix_command::Context` when it's just passed on.
   That way, the clone occours only when needed, without forcing the caller
   to pre-emptively clone each time it's called.

## v0.0.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)
